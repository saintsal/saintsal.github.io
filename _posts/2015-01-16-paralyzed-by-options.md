A few friends seem stuck in that luxurious rut: too many options.  It inspired a section for [Decision Hacks](http://decisionhacks.co):



> Too many options is a luxury - it's a type of wealth. But only when you know how to be wealthy.  Wealthy people don't slog among the clothing racks and choose the best among them. They work out what they truely want (often with help) and then have their wishes tailor-made.

> When you're spoiled by choice, it helps to start with what you really want. You'll likely be able to pick the best parts of each option, and fill in the blanks with something completely new. Not among your first options, but exactly what you wanted.
