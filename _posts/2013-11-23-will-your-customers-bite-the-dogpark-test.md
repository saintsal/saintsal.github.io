When you need prospects to see it to get it, lightweight paper prototypes can help you learn and evolve quickly.  But what about the middle ground when the customer problem/pain isn't super strong, and showing paper prototypes won't tell you if they'll really use the thing? </p><p>Christian Blunden's (@christianralph) team at Lean Startup Machine London had an idea for a social network for reconnecting dog owners who meet while walking their dogs. The crucial thing to test was if dog owners would bite. So they put up poster for a website that didn't exist, to see if people would tear off the contact information to check later.  </p><p>A great example of working out your MVP - your Minimum Viable Product! This quickly tested the riskiest part of their idea, whether people care enough to even check it out. And it test real customer behaviour - what they do, not what they say they'll do. Nice one!</p></div>      <p style="font-size: 10px;">      <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>       from <a href="http://saintsal.posterous.com/will-your-customers-bite-the-dogpark-test-cc">I'm Sal</a>      </p>      </div>
