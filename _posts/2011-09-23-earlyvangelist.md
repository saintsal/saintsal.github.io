While mentoring at Lean Startup Machine London, I covered one of the most fundamental concepts in Customer Development, the 5 characteristics on an Earlyvangelist, which Steve Blank covers in more detail in his book Four Steps To The Epiphany. Trevor grabbed me for a quick interview.

<strong>Early-Evangelists:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Have the problem you think they have</li>
	<li>Knows they have the problem</li>
	<li>Tried to solve the problem themselves</li>
	<li>Looked for a solution themselves</li>
	<li>Put budget behind solving the problem</li>
</ul>
Issues can happen when an entrepreneur finds someone who fits 3 or 4 of these traits but not all of them. The example Sal gives is when someone has everything except for the budget, you donâ€™t want to invest the time and cost in building a solution if you will end up empty handed.
