Three London skinheads are running at me, and the first thing I can think to say is, "Here Dan, hold my kebab for a sec." 

It's Angel, 2007-ish at around 1am. It's a busy drinking night and the pubs are streaming all kinds of drunken idiots onto the street, not just bald ones.

I was one of those idiots too.  The thing is, as these three Skinheads walked past me, one asked me, in a way that I assume is polite for a Nazi, "go back to Isreal, Jew."  I think he was confused by my curly black hair, and maybe threatened by my impressive big nose.  Anyway, I corrected him, "actually, I'm Muslim, moron."

I'm not even sure why I said this.  I don't believe in Islam or even in god. I think I just didn't like being picked on.

It took a while for them to process my comment, but they figured it out eventually, and turned around.

So here they are running at me in their Dr. Martens, and I'm worried about my dinner.  Not because I'm tough, but because I learned from being bullied as a kid.

Nobody ever believes me when I say I've been the victim of racism.  Ironically, because I'm white skinned.

I grew up in middle class, mixed-race family in Canada.  I was raised as an Ismaili Muslim, though I never beleived, there was a strong sense of community that taught me a lot.  Positive things, like how powerful small projects to support minorities in trouble can be. Through that community, I run a computer skills training school for Afghani refugees, and got repaid in ways I'd never have imagined.

Ismaili Muslims in Canada were Indians who had left East Africa after the political movements there made them unwelcome in their homes. In the 60s and 70s, they found a better life in Canada! 

But their kids were like any other middle-class North American kids: spoilt, wearing big pants and listening to gangster rap. Well, not quite. They were spoilt brown kids dealing with a majority of spoilt white kids.  

I was also called "a Paki" at school.  It didn't help to explain my grandparents were from Gujarat.

Layers and layers of tedious, silly racism. Fear, entitlement, vindication.

So at the age of 12, still forced to go to religious classes, I'm dealing with a bunch of Indian kids who watch Spike Lee movies, and wear Malcom X hats that their parents bought.  They'd say "kill Whitey" and attack me when nobody was around, and this had a tendency to escalate.  When one of them came crying to the teacher with a bloody nose, I made a deal to never return as long as the teachers didn't tell my parents. That eventually turned into a deal to work on the computer lab instead.

But the worst part was, years later, after investing so much into that community, running that computer school, was how I was treated by strangers. If I walked into a mosque where I wasn't known, they would stop me at the door.  I'd have to prove to them I was Muslim just because I was white.

Now, they're not bad people, they just weren't used to seeing a white Muslim. If a white person waked into the mosque, they were either lost of causing trouble, but that didn't help me feel welcome in my own community.  Neither were the white kids at school, whose parents mostly immigrated but found solace in picking on the Indians. This is messed up part about empathising with racism. You have to accept it comes from somewhere human. 

A few years ago, I'm walking through Nairobi with a black Kenyan friend, and he asks me, "what's it like to be the victim of racism?"  

I smiled, because nobody ever asked me that.  And I pointed out that it was weird to explain this to a black guy.  He pointed out he'd never experienced racism in Kenya, at least not the way I have.

It's true.  It's so different for everyone. I couldn't begin to understand what it feels like to grow up in a family whose great grandparents were slaves, or who didn't get an education or healthcare just because they lived in "wrong neighbourhood."

Again, different from the jaw-clench I feel when someone at border security ominously emphasises my Arabic middle name (Akber) with my passport in their hand, and then proceeds to interrogate me. 

And don't get me started on the dirty looks every brown person dealt with after the Tube bombings. 

It's different to be sneered at for your accent, than it is to be noticed because of your skin colour, to being fearful of an attack against your family.  It's also different to feel like your culture is threatened, or that your livelihood is at risk because you don't have a say in your government, which is controlled by people who aren't like you and don't understand you. Most people don't deal with these situations well. These all require empathy and strength to handle.

Now, race crime is spiking in London again, this time Europeans and foreigners are being victimised in relation to the Brexit. This time, it's not isolated to brown or black people being singled out, as has happened in the past.

I've personally put up with a lot of different types of racist shit for a long time, and I feel bad for those of you who are feeling this for the first time.

Here's my advice. Stand up for yourself, and stand up for others.  Not in a violent way, but in a visible way. Throw parties, hit the streets and celebrate London's diversity. Go have a picnic with Italian food and French wine, and invite the Leavers. 

Just don't be afraid.

Remember those Skinheads?  They got a few punches in, and then when they realised I could defend their strikes, it turned into an embarrassing shoving match.  

After a few minutes, they gave up, and one of them even apologised to me. You could see their anger and their frustration. We didn't go for beer or anything, but there was still a nice humanity in that moment. 

There was mutual respect.  They just needed to act out and I just needed to stand up for myself. 

And the anger just needed time to dissipate. 

Then we got on with our lives.
