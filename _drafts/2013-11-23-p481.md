<div id="_mcePaste">Rework is the new business bestseller from 37 Signals. It explains the Lean and Design Thinking approaches that have made 37 Signals and other Internet business so successful, and does this in an accessible way for those who are not familiar with digital or design-led business. I think this will change the way business is done over the next 10 years, soÂ I've created Reworkshop, an exclusive workshop with David Heinemeier Hansson, 37 Signals founder, for 15 London-based businesses.</div>
