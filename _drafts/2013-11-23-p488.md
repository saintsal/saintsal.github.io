I'm a co-creator ofÂ <a href="http://leanca.mp/">Leancamp</a>, a large-scale, open event that brings together different disciplines, such as design, entrepreneurialism and research, to find market traction faster.. For the first time ever, leaders from Lean Startup, 37 Signals, Business Model Generation and Visual Thinking will share their tools and methods. Leancamp is an opportunity to learn from world leaders in bootstrapped startups, and to discuss new, leaner ways to launch businesses with other founders.
