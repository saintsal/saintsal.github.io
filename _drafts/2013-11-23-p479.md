MHF is a charity that provides an independent and authoritative voice for male health in England and Wales and tackles the issues and inequalities affecting the health and well-being of men and boys. It runs the annual National Menâ€™s Health Week, malehealth.co.uk and leads policy development through efforts such as the All Party Group on Men's Health. I advise on digital components of their endeavours, with a focus on creating low-cost, sustainable behavioural and attitudinal change among men.
