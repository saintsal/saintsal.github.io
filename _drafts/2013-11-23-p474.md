I am working with Great Western Studios, backed by Creative Futures, to convene a Lean and Agile Thinking business community as part of the larger Great Western Studios network. This community will help foster and sustain first-time business founders, further advance Lean and Agile thinking through cross-functional collaboration, and help the larger community learn how to be financially sustainable.
