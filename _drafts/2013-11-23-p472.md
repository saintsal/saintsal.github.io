The People Speak combine digital technology and real-world group interaction to apply democracy to new contexts. They use their tools to discover emerging, relevant issues for organisations such as the Tate, Science Museum, and a number of local authorities. Â They have a large number of tools, value-propositions and clients but limited resources, a situation that prevents further growth. I am providing a process for them to articulate and crystallise a business model that will allow them to grow.
