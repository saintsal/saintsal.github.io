<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I just stumbled across this old video from The Difference Engine, one of the UK's first accelerators based in Newcastle. In it, you'll spot a young Paul Rawlings, all fidgety and nervous about giving presentations.</span>

Paul, if you don't know him, is the founder of Screen Reach, now <a href="http://www.screach.com/">Screach</a>, which is his second startup that's going like gangbusters! He's one of my favourite European founders, mainly because of his no-nonsense attitude to making money, an attitude <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/rich-vs-king-sold-company.html">usually lacking in so-called "Startup Culture."</a> Paul went on to nail down an all-star advisory board, and a few serious investment rounds – not to mention a mushrooming customer list that spans more and more industries.

Paul's attitude is interesting in this video, because he wasn't just another green startup sapling, he was already on solid footing with considerable cashflow from his last startup. Nonetheless, he was <a href="http://www.saintsal.com/2012/12/self-improvement-messing-up-your-potential/">still humble and self-aware</a> so knew where to best invest in himself. In this case, the accelerator was co-investing in the founders' pitching skills.
<h2>Better alignment with founders builds better accelerators</h2>
Towards the end of the video, you'll spot Jon Bradford. Even now that he spends 80% of his time on planes and trains, he still exudes the same energy! Jon went on to start the <a href="http://www.springboard.com">Springboard</a> accelerator in London, and helped a number of European accelerators get off the ground, many of whom I work with through <a href="http://www.foundercentric.com">Founder Centric</a>.

Jon and I became friends talking about <strong>The 97% Problem</strong>: the accelerator business model has it's limits when you want to help as many worthy founders as possible. Accelerators can't always accept all the teams they'd like; they can usually only accept 3% of applicants. Then, there's the tension between investing in founders and investing in startups, as accelerators are also measured by the performance of their underlying funds.
<h2>Timing counts, even when you invest in yourself</h2>
I like that we help continue a tradition of investing in founders as they invest in themselves. We work with accelerators to design workshop formats that help identify when and where founders get stuck, so we can bring in help on-time and on-demand.

This attitude pays back to the accelerator in other ways. For example, now Paul mentors for The Difference Engine's successor <a href="http://ignite100.com/">Ignite100</a> and Springboard among others. Doubling-down on our founders' investments in themselves pays off.

I find a certain perspective, looking at Paul and Jon in this video. Considering how they came across then and what they've achieved since, then looking at the current batch of startup hopefuls, I wonder, how we can do better at aligning with the investments founders are already making in themselves?
