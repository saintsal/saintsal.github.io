<p>I'm a startup founder and educator.
<p>I recently founded <a href="http://source.institute">Source Institute</a> which develops peer-to-peer education that stays relevant in our fast-changing world. Our programmes include: <a href="http://leancamp.co/">Leancamp</a>, <a href="http://villageaccelerator.org">Village Accelerator</a> and <a href="http://thesources.co">The Sources</a> to name a few. 

<p>I'm also known for starting <a href="http://foundercentric.com/">Founder Centric</a>, which designed startup workshops for Europe's accelerators and universities.  And back in the day, starting 5 tech companies - IT service providers, ecommerce and digital advertising. 

<p>I've designed startup education programmes for UCL, Oxford, Seedcamp, Creative Accelerator, and the Africa Prize For Engineering.

<p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:smile@saintsal.com">smile@saintsal.com</a> and <a  href="http://eepurl.com/JoTLL">stay in touch by getting my newsletter</a>, where I occasionally share my experience and research on startup community building, humanitech, open/hacker culture, and privacy.
