<p>I'm a startup founder and educator.
<p>I recently founded <a href="http://source.institute">Source Institute</a> which develops new forms of peer-to-peer education, designed for fast-changing contexts where traditional education is too slow and irrelevant. (Think tech startups in Africa, or agritech innovation in global supply chains.)  We're working diligently to acheive global impact and our programmes include: <a href="http://leancamp.co/">Leancamp</a>, <a href="http://villageaccelerator.org">Village Accelerator</a> and <a href="http://thesources.co">The Sources</a> to name a few. 

<p>I'm also known for starting <a href="http://foundercentric.com/">Founder Centric</a>, a boutique design house for startup workshops taught by experienced founders.  And back in the day, starting 5 other companies - IT service providers, ecommerce and digital advertising. 

<p>I've designed and delivered startup education programmes for some of the world's best and most diverse, from Seedcamp to Creative Accelerator, from ClimateKIC to the Africa Prize For Engineering, from Oxford University to UCL. 

<p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:smile@saintsal.com">smile@saintsal.com</a> and <a  href="http://eepurl.com/JoTLL">stay in touch by getting my newsletter</a>, where I occasionally share my experience and research on startup community building, humanitech, open/hacker culture, and privacy.
